My current role is Principal Software Engineer at Sandel Avionics, where I am primarily responsible for development of Flight Management System (FMS) application software. In addition, I'm responsible for the design and implementation of the navigation database, continuous integration (CI) pipelines, and build tools for all of our applications (both Linux and embedded). Test-driven development (TDD) is employed, and software is developed in accordance with RTCA DO-178C. Testing, internal tools and CI use C++, Python 3, and Git. I enjoy working in a team environment, am a quick and independent learner, and am passionate about mentoring and helping others.",
